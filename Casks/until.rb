  caveats <<~EOS
    Until sends one anonymous ping a day: a hash of you, a hash of your
    Workspace, and the Until version. It never sends names, emails,
    repository names or Ticket content.
    See exactly what it sends with `untl telemetry`. Turn it off with
    `untl telemetry off`, or set UNTIL_TELEMETRY=0 or DO_NOT_TRACK=1.

    To get started from the command line, run:

        $ untl
  EOS
end
